- Implement secure user authentication, property search/filtering, detailed views, and a streamlined checkout process.
- Foster collaboration through defined roles, version control, and documentation.
- Ensure accessibility, performance, and maintainability for real-world deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for component-based architecture)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX mockups

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive booking flow that guides users effortlessly from search to confirmation.
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages using a unified design system.
- Ensure fast loading times through optimized assets and efficient code.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness to support users on any device.

### Key Features
